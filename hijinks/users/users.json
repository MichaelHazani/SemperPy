    "bio": "Oogie Boogie is the sadistic, abusive, insane, and voraciously power-hungry Boogie Man, resembling a large burlap sack shaped like a starfish. Inside of him are thousands of bugs (along with 2 spiders and a snake). His life revolves around gambling and loves gambling with others' lives. He likes to torture people. He also used to be the king of his own holiday, "Bug Day", which eventually fell out of favor, resulting in him moving to Halloween Town. He also fears Jack Skellington, as evidenced by their final confrontation when meeting face to face. This fear was a result of their first meeting, when Jack Skellington destroyed a majority of his bug minions after he attempted to transform Halloween Town into the new Bug Day. "
